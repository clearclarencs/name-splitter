Feel free to create a pull request if you feel there is an improvement that you can add.


Primarily for NeoRaffle program, takes email in first column of csv and attempts to extract the first and surname from it.

File structure:

<br/>
tasks.csv:

```EMAIL,FIRST NAME,LAST NAME,HOUSE NUMBER,ADDRESS LINE 1,ADDRESS LINE 2,CITY,POSTCODE / ZIP,STATE/PROVINCE/REGION,COUNTRY,PASSWORD,PHONE PREFIX (e.g. +49),INSTAGRAM```

Then simply run the program, depending on tasks length and machine specs could take a while.

Will output to form-done.csv to check and copy over.
