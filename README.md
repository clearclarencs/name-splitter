Please star this repo if it helped, people have told me I could charge for this program but I feel this should be available to the community and a star helps build my reputation as a developer.


Feel free to create a pull request if you feel there is an improvement that you can add.


Primarily for NeoRaffle program, takes email in first column of csv and attempts to extract the first and surname from it.


Place exe or py in the same directory as tasks.csv, for neoraffle this is the General Settings folder

tasks.csv:

```EMAIL,...```

Then simply run the program, depending on tasks length and machine specs could take a while.

Will output to form-done.csv to check and copy over.

If you wish to adapt to a different setup / raffle bot please and wish to add please use a branch.

*exe is windows only*
